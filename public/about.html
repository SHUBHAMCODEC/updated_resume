<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Shubham Sharma, and I am a first-year BTech student 
  studying at Sharda University in Greater Noida, India. With a passion for web 
  development, I have dedicated myself to creating unique websites for various purposes. 
  I find joy in the process of crafting websites that are not only visually appealing but 
  also highly functional. My commitment to learning and improving my skills led me to enroll 
  in a full stack development course on Udemy, which has further expanded my knowledge and 
  capabilities in this field. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have a strong academic 
  background, having secured an impressive 90.6 percent in my 12th-grade examinations 
  and 83.4 percent in 10th grade.</p>
  
<p>Beyond academic achievements, I have also actively participated in the National Cadet Corps (NCC)
   program, where I earned an 'A' level certificate. The NCC camp I attended allowed me to develop
   essential qualities such as leadership, empathy, hard work, and problem-solving. These experiences
   have shaped my character and given me a broader perspective on teamwork and collaboration. 
   I believe that these qualities are valuable assets that I can bring to any professional environment,
   including web development projects.</p>
<p> Currently, I am focused on honing my skills as a web developer and keeping up with the latest trends 
  and technologies in the industry. I have a keen eye for detail, a creative mindset, and the ability 
  to adapt to new challenges. I approach each project with enthusiasm and a strong work ethic, striving 
  for excellence in every aspect of my work. I believe that my combination of technical knowledge, 
  leadership abilities, and dedication to continuous improvement makes me a well-rounded and valuable
  asset in the field of web development.</p>
